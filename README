uFFT is a small portable C library for computing the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) in one dimension.

The library implements forward fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. The
inverse transform is not implemented as it can be computed using the existing
forward transform. For example, the inverse transform is the same as the forward
one with the real and imaginary parts swapped for both input and output.

The library is written in pure C99. No compiler extensions nor assembly language
are employed. It uses floating point data type and can handle unaligned data.
The FFT routines can be easily modified since their source code has less than a
hundred lines. As you might expect, the uFFT performance does not outperform the
performance of FFTW. The library uses one temporary array as large as the input
array.
